# cynkrathis

Package to simplify project scaffolding and common {renv} related tasks.

## cynkra RSPM snapshots

cynkra makes use of certain RStudio Package Manager (RSPM) snapshots across projects.
Usually each R Version is tied to a snapshot near it's release date.
If a snapshot is considered unstable due to certain R package version clashes, additional snapshots for specific R versions can be listed.

```{r }
cynkrathis::get_snapshots()
```

## Initialize {renv} with a given RSPM snapshot

Choose the `"date"` column that is returned by `get_valid_snapshots()`.
For example, for R 3.6.3 this would be "2020-02-29".

```{r, eval=FALSE}
cynkrathis::init_renv()
```
